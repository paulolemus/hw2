## HW2 Evaluation - Jessica Grazziotin - Team Sandwich


## 1) What I learned from this homework:

This homework I learned how to implement the templates that we discussed in lab to
our bank account and list lab. I also learned how difficult, yet crucial it is to be able to work with a 
provided code that you shouldn't or sometimes can't change like a provided .h file for example.
I also learned to appreciate lists through this homework. They are much easier to manipulate 
than an array or vector. 


## 2) My Contributions
(separated by file)
## bankwithlist.cpp (Other Contributors: Matthew - driver, Paulo - template setup)
This file is responsible for interfacing the list functions with the bank account functions. 
We tried our best to follow the template model that Paulo mentioned earlier. So in this file the "T" was 
our "BankAccount" type. This added a level of complexity to mapping what each varible type was and 
where it came from. I primarily worked on the functions and Matt worked on the logic flow
for the driver. 

The most challenging part for this file for me was writing functions that would 
agree with the format of the singlylinked.h and BankAccount files. Since this was a group
project and some of us were working remotely, we wanted to avoid altering those files as much as 
possible. So there were several times where it became very difficult to manipulate a function solely
based on the design of a seperate functions' return or input. 

## BasicAccount.cpp & BasicAccount.h (Matthew, Jessie, Paulo)

This contains the bank account class that was used for our previous lab


## Other Contributions

To help me learn what was going on, I decided to go through the code and comment everything.
I also compiled our written work and photos and prepared the files for the final submission. 


## 3) Questions:
What about when there are links with the same element? Like the same name for example? 
Should we force someone to have a different name? Or to only search by account. 

What would be a way to take advantage of the template here and apply it to a different example? 


## 4) Comments:
I'll start off the bat with honestly saying that as far as the working lines of code are 
concerned, I probably have the least amount of the three of us that was my original design. 
It was very difficult for me to grasp the templates at first. I finally reached out to the guys and 
told them how stuck I was and they helped me a lot. After that it was down hill and I was able to 
create some functions that benefitted our group assignment.
The guys helped me a lot with conceptualizing how the files would work together and with the 
driver. I also compiled our written work and photos and prepared the files for the final submission.

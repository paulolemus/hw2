# what our program does:

the bankwithlist executable begins with a simple interface which
allows the user to add, search for, or delete a BasicAccount.
The user is also given the options to print all bank accounts or close the program.
The user cannot add a bankaccount that has the same ID as an existing one.
The user can search by name OR ID. If an account is found, the user is
prompted if he/she would like to withdraw or deposit.
The user can also delete an account when given a name or ID.
The program expects the user to enter valid entries to each input field.
TLDR: It works pretty well.

# Files:

bankwithlist.cpp
BasicAccount.cpp
BasicAccount.h
singlylinked.h
testdriver.cpp
testdriver2.cpp
testdriver3.cpp
makefile
README.md
evalJessie.md
evalMatt.md
evalPaulo.md

# To make:

type: `make`
This should make the bankwithlist.cpp into a bankwithlist exec.
